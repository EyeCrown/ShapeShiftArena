Shapeshift Arena is a fighting game for up to 4 players.

Use your sizeshift gun to shrink or enlarge your opponent and smash them against the arena’s deadly walls.
The bigger you are and the smaller your opponent, greater is the impact.  So maneuver well and fast to take the lead!
The game ends when one of the players has won 5 rounds. **Good luck!**
